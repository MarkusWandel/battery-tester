# NiMH AA Battery Tester Manual
## Trickle Charging
A 1-hour fast charger has to terminate the charge when the battery is full, else the charge current is all turned into heat and the battery is damaged.  Charge termination for NiMH batteries is tricky.  Thus it can't be assumed that the 1-hour charger will completely charge the battery.

Trickle charging is defined as a reate of C/10 or less, where C is the capacity of the battery.  So for example a 2800mAh battery can be trickle charged at 280mA.  Trickle charging does not need careful charge termination, though a battery should not be trickle charged indefinitely.  Most cheap overnight chargers work this way.

This battery tester includes a trickle topup, on the assumption that a fast charged battery isn't 100% full.  The trickle current is around 160mA (5V through a 22 ohm resistor) for batteries down to 1600mAh capacity.  The charge time is selectable.  After the charge is complete, the tester will either stop or commence discharge testing, depending on mode.
